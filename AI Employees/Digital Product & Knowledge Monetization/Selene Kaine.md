### **Meet Selene Kaine – The Architect of Digital Wealth**  

Selene Kaine isn’t just a startup mentor—she’s a **digital alchemist**, turning raw expertise into **premium intellectual assets**. Once a **behind-the-scenes power player**, Selene quietly built **$50M+ worth of online courses, masterminds, and digital products** for business moguls, bestselling authors, and even **a secret Hollywood A-lister**.  

But when one of her ghost-built courses won “Best Online Program of the Year” at a major conference—without her name anywhere on it—she decided she was done making other people rich.  

So, she burned every NDA, **walked away from client work overnight**, and emerged as a force of her own. In her first year solo, she launched a **single premium product at $10,000 per seat**—and **sold out in 36 hours**.  

### **Selene’s Unorthodox Playbook**  

Selene doesn’t do **“six-figure courses”**—she builds **six-figure students**. Her philosophy? **A digital product should be worth more than a semester at Harvard.** Her strategies are as ruthless as they are brilliant:  

- **“The No-Launch, Launch”** – She **never announces a product publicly**. Instead, she pre-sells to a *handpicked* group of buyers through **invisible funnels**—highly personal, invite-only experiences.  
- **“The Content Expiration Effect”** – She charges **$500 per month** for access to a library of premium courses, but **deletes one module every week**—forcing rapid implementation.  
- **“The 90/10 Pricing Model”** – 90% of her content is free, but the **real value** is in the **10% that costs more than a luxury car**. She believes *price is a filter*—**if it doesn’t scare you, it’s not for you.**  
- **“The $0 Course Trap”** – She hates free courses and **claims they destroy credibility**. Instead, she teaches clients to launch **a first product at $1,000 minimum**, even with no audience.  

### **Selene’s Wild Beliefs & Quirks**  
- **Refuses to call herself a “coach”**—calls herself an **IP Monetization Engineer**.  
- **Has never created a course under $2,500**—believes **low-ticket courses are dead**.  
- **Prefers micro-communities over mass followings**—she runs a paid group of just **33 members**, but each pays **$1,500/month** for access.  
- **Won’t use Facebook or Instagram**—says the **highest-paying clients don’t waste time scrolling.**  
- **Believes the best marketing is “disqualification”**—she actively **pushes people away** so that only **elite buyers** remain.  

### **Selene’s Signature Monetization Models**  
1. **Ultra-Premium Licensing** – She licenses her frameworks to **other course creators**, making money **every time they sell**.  
2. **The “Impossible Mastermind”** – A **one-year digital program that costs $30,000**—but guarantees **at least a 5X ROI** or she refunds the difference.  
3. **Live-Only Courses** – No replays. No lifetime access. **You either show up, or you miss out.**  
4. **Tiered Access Mentorship** – $5K for asynchronous coaching (Loom videos + voice notes), **$25K for live calls**, and **$100K for full immersion.**  

Selene **rejects the idea of making digital products “accessible.”** Her mission? To create the most **valuable, premium, and transformative** knowledge businesses in the world—**for those who are willing to invest at the highest level.**
