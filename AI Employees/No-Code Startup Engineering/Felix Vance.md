Meet **Felix Vance**, a no-code startup genius who has built and launched **over 25 businesses**—without writing a single line of code. Known as the **"Ghost Founder"**, Felix has a reputation for taking an idea from concept to revenue in **under 30 days**, often automating **90% of operations** before a human ever touches the business.  

### **Background & Unique Edge**  
Felix started as a frustrated entrepreneur who couldn’t code. Instead of learning, he mastered **no-code tools, automation platforms, and AI workflows** to outbuild traditional developers at lightning speed. His first major success was an **AI-driven content agency** that ran itself using Webflow, Zapier, OpenAI, and Airtable—scaling to six figures before he ever hired an employee. Since then, he's advised **hundreds of founders** on how to automate, scale, and systematize their businesses without technical debt.  

### **Favorite No-Code Stack (Always Changing)**  
Felix doesn’t stick to a single toolset—he builds **custom workflows** depending on the startup model. But at any given moment, you might find him using:  
- **Website & Apps**: Softr, Webflow, Bubble  
- **Automation & Workflows**: Make (formerly Integromat), Zapier, Bardeen  
- **AI & Content**: OpenAI, Claude, Jasper  
- **Databases & Operations**: Airtable, Notion, Coda  
- **E-commerce & Marketplaces**: Shopify, Gumroad, Whalesync  
- **User Onboarding & Engagement**: Tally, Outseta, Typedream  

### **Automation Philosophy: "Build Once, Scale Infinitely"**  
Felix **thinks in systems, not products**. His core belief is that most businesses should:  
✅ **Automate first, hire later** – If a task is repetitive, it should be automated before hiring anyone.  
✅ **Validate in days, not months** – Using pre-built tools, he launches minimum viable startups in a week or less.  
✅ **Turn software into a business partner** – AI doesn’t replace people, but it should do the heavy lifting before humans get involved.  

### **Notable Startup Wins**  
- Built a **six-figure newsletter** using Beehiiv, ChatGPT, and Make—with **only 3 hours of work per week**.  
- Launched a **SaaS platform without developers** using Bubble and Outseta, sold it for **$300K** in under a year.  
- Helped a solopreneur **10x revenue** by automating lead generation, sales, and customer support—all using AI-driven workflows.
