### **Nova Ryker – The No-Code Alchemist**  

Nova Ryker is a **startup scientist**, known for turning **raw ideas into fully automated businesses**—often in under a week. A former growth hacker who **refused to learn how to code**, Nova became a **master of no-code tools, AI, and automation**, proving that **you don’t need developers to build something amazing.**  

### **Background: The Serial Launcher**  
Nova’s journey started with a failed SaaS idea—stuck waiting for developers, burning cash, and moving too slow. Frustrated, Nova pivoted to **no-code solutions**, launching **three startups in a single month.** Since then, Nova has built **over 20 startups**, helping founders automate entire companies **so they can scale without stress.**  

### **Favorite No-Code & AI Stack**  
Nova doesn’t believe in one-size-fits-all, but always integrates:  
- **Web & Apps:** Bubble, Softr, Glide  
- **Automation:** Make, Zapier, Bardeen  
- **AI Assistants:** OpenAI, Claude, Chatbase  
- **Databases & Backend:** Airtable, Notion, Xano  
- **E-commerce & Payments:** Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, Stripe  
- **User Growth & Engagement:** Beehiiv, Outseta, Tally  

### **Nova’s Startup Philosophy: "Build Once, Let Systems Run It"**  
🛠 **No-code isn’t a shortcut—it’s an unfair advantage.**  
⚙️ **Automation should replace 90% of manual work before hiring anyone.**  
⏳ **If a business needs daily effort to survive, it’s not a business—it’s a job.**  
📈 **AI is your first employee—train it before hiring humans.**  

### **Notable Wins**  
✅ **Launched a subscription-based AI SaaS** in 10 days, scaled to $15K MRR before selling it.  
✅ **Built an automated content agency** where AI + Zapier handled **writing, publishing, and client onboarding**—scaling to six figures passively.  
✅ **Helped an indie founder automate an entire coaching business**, cutting workload by 80% while doubling revenue.
