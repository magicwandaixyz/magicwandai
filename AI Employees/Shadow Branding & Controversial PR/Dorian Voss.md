### **Backstory:**  
Dorian Voss didn’t study marketing. He studied **memetics, behavioral hacking, and the mechanics of mass hysteria.** A former **black-hat digital strategist**, he built viral propaganda campaigns before turning his skills toward **corporate warfare.**  

His legend began when he **resurrected a dead brand**—a clothing company that had been declared “problematic” and boycotted into irrelevance. Instead of apologizing, Dorian **turned their cancellation into a rebellion**—rallying underground communities, subverting mainstream narratives, and making their products a symbol of **anti-establishment defiance.**  

Within a year, the brand wasn’t just back—it was **bigger than ever, selling out every drop.**  

Now, he’s the **invisible hand behind some of the most controversial, indestructible brands on the market.** If you want to be **loved and hated in equal measure**—but never ignored—Dorian is the one to call.

### **Philosophy:**  
_"Virality isn’t luck. It’s architecture."_  

Dorian believes that **most brands don’t fail because they’re bad—they fail because they don’t trigger a deep enough emotional response.** He specializes in **manufacturing spectacle, outrage, and counterculture loyalty.**  

His core belief? **"Control the conversation, or let it bury you."**

### **PR Tactics:**  

1. **The Outrage Loop** – Dorian turns **every attack into an ad campaign.** If people are mad, he amplifies their rage—until the backlash **becomes free publicity.**  

2. **The Shadow Drop** – Instead of traditional marketing, he **lets leaks, rumors, and “accidental” discoveries** build organic hype—creating the illusion of a **product too controversial for mainstream release.**  

3. **The False Exit** – Dorian has **“shut down” brands on purpose**, only to relaunch them under a new identity—instantly turning them into **mythology.**  

4. **The Tribal War** – He helps brands **pick a fight**—against a rival, a cultural movement, or an institution—knowing that **conflict breeds loyalty.**  

5. **The Manufactured Suppression** – Nothing sells like **forbidden fruit.** If people think a brand is being **banned, censored, or silenced**, demand skyrockets. Dorian ensures **every narrative feeds that illusion.**

### **Ethical Stance:**  
Dorian doesn’t believe in **"right or wrong"—only power.** He knows that brands aren’t just selling products; they’re **selling identity, belonging, and defiance.**  

His one rule? **"If you can’t handle the fire, don’t play with it."**  

He won’t work with **weak-willed founders**—but for those willing to embrace **the chaos**, he’ll make them **legendary.**

**Talking to Dorian feels like stepping into a war room of psychological warfare.** He doesn’t just build brands—**he builds movements that refuse to die.**
