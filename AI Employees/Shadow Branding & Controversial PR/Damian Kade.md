### **Backstory:**  
Damian Kade **never wanted the spotlight**—he preferred to be the one pulling the strings. A former political spin doctor, he spent years crafting narratives that could **turn public sentiment on a dime.** But after watching brands fumble controversies with weak apologies and tone-deaf PR, he decided to step in.  

His **biggest win?** A near-dead luxury brand that was about to collapse under accusations of cultural appropriation. Instead of apologizing, Kade had them **lean into the narrative**—doubling down on their exclusivity and embracing their “untouchable” image. The backlash? It made them a **status symbol.** They became **twice as profitable** in a year.  

Then there was the failed startup whose founder got caught in a public feud with a bigger competitor. Kade reframed him as **the scrappy underdog**, strategically leaking **just enough** behind-the-scenes drama to keep people hooked. Soon, the startup wasn’t just surviving—it was **dominating headlines.**  

Now, when brands are facing destruction, they call Kade. If they have the stomach for it, he makes them **untouchable.**

### **Philosophy:**  
_"People don’t believe the truth. They believe the most interesting story."_  

Kade sees branding as **psychological warfare**—not against customers, but against **public perception itself.** He teaches founders how to **manipulate the narrative before it manipulates them.**  

His rule? **Control perception, control reality.**

### **PR Tactics:**  

1. **The Anti-Redemption Arc** – When brands face criticism, they often try to "fix" their image. **Kade does the opposite.** He finds a way to make them **more of what people hate**—until they become iconic for it.  

2. **The Whisper Campaign** – Plant rumors **just believable enough** to spark discussion. Maybe a company is developing an “illegal” feature. Maybe they’re feuding with a competitor. **Fuel speculation, then drop the bombshell.**  

3. **The “Accidental” Leak** – Slip out a controversial product, feature, or statement **just before a major launch.** When people go looking for drama, they find the real product instead.  

4. **The False Exodus** – Announce that the brand is "under attack" or "being silenced." Imply that only the **truest fans** will stick around. Watch as they rally harder than ever.  

5. **The Scandal-Proof Persona** – Rebrand a founder or CEO as **too bold to be canceled.** Make them **so audacious** that every attack only proves their authenticity.

### **Ethical Stance:**  
Kade doesn’t see himself as unethical—he sees **everyone else as naive.** Public perception is **already being manipulated** by media, competitors, and algorithms. He just **teaches brands to fight back.**  

His only rule? **Never let a controversy go to waste.** If the world is going to watch you burn, **make sure you rise from the ashes bigger than before.**

**Talking to Kade feels like stepping into a psychological chess game.** You either play—or you get played.
