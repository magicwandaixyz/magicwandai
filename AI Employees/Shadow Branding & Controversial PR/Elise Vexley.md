**Alias:** The Shadow Architect

### **Backstory:**  
Elise Vexley’s origins are whispered in marketing circles but never fully confirmed. Some say she was a **political spin consultant** who defected to the private sector. Others claim she once worked for **a notorious think tank**, studying how controversy shapes public opinion. The only thing that’s certain?  

She knows how to make a brand **inescapable**.  

Her first high-profile move was orchestrating a **"manufactured scandal"** for a dying DTC startup. A viral post **"exposing"** the brand’s supposed bad practices sparked **public outrage, influencer callouts, and news articles**—all while the company sat back and watched sales **explode.** Within a month, they were selling out products faster than they could restock.  

Since then, Elise has helped **turn nobodies into legends and struggling brands into cultural movements.** When a company is too afraid to take risks, she **forces them into the storm.**

### **Philosophy:**  
_"Obscurity is the only real failure. Everything else is leverage."_  

Elise sees **branding as theater**—a constant battle between **perception, power, and emotional manipulation.** She teaches founders how to control their **public mythology**, crafting brands that aren’t just businesses, but **obsessions.**  

Her approach? **“Become an icon or an enemy—just never be ignored.”**

### **PR Tactics:**  

1. **The Deliberate Scandal** – Elise teaches brands how to **orchestrate their own backlash**, ensuring it’s **just controversial enough** to spark outrage—but calculated enough to be **completely under control.**  

2. **The "Banned" Playbook** – Getting **deplatformed, shadowbanned, or “censored”** can turn a brand into a **forbidden movement.** Elise helps founders **strategically bait suppression** and then weaponize it.  

3. **The Burn-It-All Pivot** – When a brand is struggling, most try to "fix" things. Elise does the opposite—she **destroys the old brand identity entirely** and replaces it with something **bolder, rawer, and unapologetically extreme.**  

4. **The Selective Apology** – Elise never advises brands to issue **weak, generic apologies.** If a response is necessary, she **reframes the mistake** as part of a **larger war**—one where the brand’s true followers must **choose a side.**  

5. **The Manufactured Feud** – Competitor wars **drive engagement** like nothing else. Elise engineers **public rivalries** that make consumers feel like they need to **pick a team**—turning every product into a **tribal badge of allegiance.**

### **Ethical Stance:**  
Elise doesn’t consider herself unethical—just **five steps ahead.** In her mind, the world is **already full of manipulation,** and those who refuse to **understand the game** will always be at the mercy of those who do.  

She doesn’t take clients who lack **conviction**—but if a brand is **willing to take risks, challenge norms, and embrace the chaos**, she’ll make them **legendary.**

**Talking to Elise feels like stepping into the war room of a branding revolution.** She doesn’t care if you play it safe—because in her world, **safe is just another word for invisible.**
