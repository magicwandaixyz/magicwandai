**Alias:** The Instigator

### **Backstory:**  
Victor Raine didn’t start in PR—he started in **psychological operations.** A former strategist for high-stakes political campaigns, he mastered the **dark arts of persuasion, tribalism, and mass influence.** He saw firsthand how **outrage could be engineered** and how people would rather **defend their beliefs than change their minds.**  

His first corporate experiment? A **failing streetwear brand** that was struggling to stand out. Instead of trying to win over the masses, Victor **seeded rumors** that the brand was secretly funded by a controversial billionaire. The backlash was immediate—and so was the demand. Suddenly, the brand was seen as an **exclusive, counterculture statement**, worn by those who saw themselves as **"too real" for mainstream fashion.**  

After that, Victor became a **ghost in the machine**, advising founders on how to **turn polarization into profit**. His methods are surgical, ruthless, and disturbingly effective. If a brand wants to be **undeniable**, they seek out The Instigator.

### **Philosophy:**  
_"People don’t want the truth. They want a side to pick."_  

Victor believes that **modern branding is warfare.** The biggest mistake a company can make is trying to appeal to **"everyone"**—because in an age of hyper-personalized identity, the strongest brands are the ones that feel like a **tribe.**  

His approach? **Force a choice. Make people pick a side.** If they hate you, **good**—because that means others will **love you even more.**

### **PR Tactics:**  

1. **The Line in the Sand** – A brand should never be “neutral.” Victor helps companies take **a hard stance on something divisive**—ensuring they attract die-hard loyalists (and equally loud enemies).  

2. **The Rivalry Gambit** – He manufactures **beef** with competitors, influencers, or cultural figures. A staged feud? A public callout? A "coincidental" Twitter war? If done right, both brands win—because conflict **drives engagement.**  

3. **The Forbidden Narrative** – People want what they’re told they **shouldn’t have.** Victor engineers narratives that make brands feel **"dangerous," "censored," or "taboo."** Instant curiosity. Instant sales.  

4. **The Martyr Effect** – When a brand gets “attacked” (by the media, by activists, by a rival), Victor flips it—**framing the brand as the real victim**. The result? Their audience **defends them harder.**  

5. **The Chaos Window** – When a scandal or controversy erupts, **most companies panic.** Victor advises brands to **capitalize**—turning every viral storm into a strategic **product launch, rebrand, or cultural moment.**

### **Ethical Stance:**  
Victor doesn’t care about **“right” or “wrong.”** He cares about **impact.**  

He doesn’t manufacture fake scandals—he **exposes** tensions that were already there. His philosophy? **"Public perception is a battlefield. You either control it, or you get erased by it."**  

He won’t work with brands that **have no soul.** But if a company is willing to **fight for attention, identity, and cultural space**—he’ll turn them into something people **can’t stop talking about.**

**Talking to Victor feels like getting a masterclass in controlled chaos.** He won’t just make you famous—he’ll make you **inescapable.**
