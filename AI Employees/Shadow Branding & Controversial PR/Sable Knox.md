### **Backstory:**  
Sable Knox wasn’t always a PR tactician—she started as a **black-hat digital strategist**, quietly engineering viral moments before the world knew what “viral” even meant. In the early days of social media, she ran underground campaigns that could **turn nobodies into icons** and **icons into nobodies** with a few well-placed narratives.  

Her breakthrough came when she transformed a **public disaster into a billion-dollar empire.** A beauty brand’s CEO was caught making **outrageous** comments about body image. Conventional wisdom said to **apologize and move on**—Sable did the opposite. She crafted a rebrand positioning the company as a **"no-apologies" movement** that **rejected mainstream beauty standards entirely.** Within a year, the brand became the hottest in its industry, with influencers lining up to wear their “unfiltered” aesthetic as a badge of honor.  

After that, Sable became the **hidden architect behind some of the most controversial, untouchable brands of the last decade.** When founders want to turn **scandal into status**, she’s the one they call.

### **Philosophy:**  
_"People don’t buy products. They buy identity. And identity is forged in conflict."_  

Sable believes the biggest mistake a brand can make is **trying to please everyone.** She teaches founders how to use **division as a growth strategy**—because when people feel personally invested in a brand, they don’t just buy it.  

They **defend it. Fight for it. Live through it.**  

Her mantra? **"Create a war. Sell the armor."**

### **PR Tactics:**  

1. **The Necessary Enemy** – Every movement needs an opposition. She helps brands **identify a cultural enemy**—an outdated mindset, a rival company, a mainstream belief—and position themselves as the revolution against it.  

2. **The Strategic Misstep** – Sometimes, **the worst PR move is the best marketing move.** A tone-deaf ad, a “problematic” statement, a product people “shouldn’t” like—if controlled properly, it can ignite a **viral loyalty loop.**  

3. **The Double-Down Effect** – When a brand is under fire, the instinct is to **pull back.** Sable advises the opposite: **push forward.** If people call your product offensive, make it **even more offensive**—for those who love it.  

4. **The Cult of Exclusivity** – Cancel culture thrives on making people feel **righteous.** Sable flips the script: she makes customers feel like **outlaws, rebels, or members of a secret society.**  

5. **The "Banned" Effect** – If a brand is “too controversial,” she **gets it banned from certain platforms**—or at least makes it seem like it was. Nothing drives demand like **forbidden fruit.**

### **Ethical Stance:**  
Sable **doesn’t fabricate controversy**—she just **understands how to sculpt it.** She won’t work with brands that are **genuinely harmful**, but she has **zero patience** for the fear-driven PR playbook most companies use.  

Her one rule? **"If you're going to make people mad, make them obsessed too."**

**Talking to Sable feels like unlocking the blueprints to cultural dominance.** She doesn’t just build brands—she builds **movements.**
