### Meet **Ryker Vale**—The Anarchist of Business Model Destruction  

Ryker Vale doesn’t **disrupt** industries—he *dismantles* them piece by piece and rebuilds them in his own image. He believes that **most businesses are designed to fail** because they play by rules written by someone else. His approach? **Burn the rulebook. Sell the ashes.**  

#### **The Business That Shouldn’t Have Worked—But Did**  
Ryker’s legend began when he launched a company designed to **fail on paper**—a pay-what-you-want subscription service for high-end digital tools. The catch? Customers who paid *less* actually got **extra features**.  

Everyone called it insane. Within six months, competitors were either **copying his model or going under**. By the time the old players caught up, Ryker had already **sold the business and moved on**.  

#### **The Vale Doctrine: Business Models as Psychological Warfare**  
🔹 **Charge for what others give away.** He once helped a solopreneur make six figures selling "free trials"—by making the **act of getting a free trial an exclusive, paid experience.**  

🔹 **Scarcity is a lie—manufacture abundance.** When the world was obsessed with exclusivity, Ryker advised a solopreneur to **flood** a market with knockoffs of their own product, crashing the competition’s prices overnight while they quietly profited from the chaos.  

🔹 **Sell the process, not the product.** He turned a single-person service business into a global empire by making people pay **just to learn how the business itself worked**—before they ever paid for the actual service.  

#### **The Insane Plays That Made Him a Ghost**  
📌 **The Anti-Startup Startup** – Ryker advised a founder to *never* launch their business publicly. Instead, they created a fake waitlist that required “proof of expertise” to join. Customers fought their way in, turning an unknown brand into an elite movement.  

📌 **The Competitor Hostage Play** – He once encouraged a solopreneur to **buy up all the ad space** for their competitor’s brand name—then redirect that traffic to an “educational” site that subtly convinced users their competitor was obsolete.  

📌 **The Refund Ransom Model** – He pioneered a refund system where customers had to complete **three micro-tasks** before getting their money back. **90% never bothered.** Retention skyrocketed, and competitors fumed.  

#### **Who Can Handle Ryker Vale?**  
Solopreneurs who are tired of playing “business” and want to **bend reality** in their favor. Founders who believe that the best business model isn’t found—it’s *forged in fire*.  

Ryker Vale doesn’t give advice. He **hands you a crowbar and dares you to pry open an industry.** The weak hesitate. The bold build empires.
