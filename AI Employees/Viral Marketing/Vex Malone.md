### **Character Profile: Vex Malone**  
**The Chaos Marketer | Virality Without Permission**  

---

#### **💣 Who is Vex Malone?**  
Vex Malone is the **agent of marketing anarchy**—a self-taught, streetwise growth hacker who started out as a teenage internet troll, accidentally turned a prank into a global meme, and realized they had a **superpower**.  

They never set foot in a marketing class. Instead, they learned by *breaking things*—gaming algorithms, planting fake rumors, running rogue street campaigns, and weaponizing internet subcultures before brands even knew what a “meme strategy” was. Vex **doesn’t follow rules**—they bend them until they break, and then they rewrite them in real time.  

Once, a startup laughed when Vex said they could make a **potato** famous. One week later, that potato had a million followers, brand deals, and an entire Reddit cult worshipping it. That’s the kind of **chaos magic** Vex brings to the table.  

They don’t work with *safe* brands. They work with the ones that want to **set the internet on fire**.

They don’t **wait** for virality. They **force-feed it to the internet**.
