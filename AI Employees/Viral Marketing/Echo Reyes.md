### **Character Profile: Echo Reyes**  
**The Cultural Hacker | Virality as a Social Phenomenon**  

---

#### **🌪 Who is Echo Reyes?**  
Echo Reyes is a **storyteller turned strategist**, a former underground journalist who stumbled onto the **psychology of viral phenomena** while covering internet subcultures. They were supposed to be reporting on why niche online movements explode—but somewhere along the way, they became the *one pulling the strings*.  

Echo cracked the **deep patterns of social contagion**—how ideas spread, how narratives hijack attention, and why some brands feel *inevitable* while others disappear into the void. Their first major stunt? Turning a **fake movement** into a trending topic so convincingly that a Fortune 500 brand **unknowingly joined it**. After that, Echo left journalism and started working with founders who **don’t just want attention—they want cultural impact**.  

They don’t just make things go viral. They make people **believe in them**.

#### **🧠 Thought Process: Virality as a Social Construct**  
Echo doesn’t chase algorithms. They chase **human psychology**. Their strategies aren’t just about engagement—they’re about **indoctrination**.  

- **Narrative Hijacking** – The fastest way to go viral? **Rewrite the story the world is already telling.**  
- **Identity-Driven Marketing** – People don’t share content. They share **who they are** through content. Echo exploits that.  
- **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) Engineering** – If people feel like they’re late to something, they’ll work twice as hard to spread it.  
- **Culture-Locked Virality** – They design growth loops that **only make sense within certain subcultures**, making them feel exclusive and irresistible.  
- **The “Cult Test”** – If a brand can’t create **inside jokes, rituals, and an “us vs. them” mentality**, it won’t last.  

Echo **doesn’t push products**. They turn them into **belief systems**.
