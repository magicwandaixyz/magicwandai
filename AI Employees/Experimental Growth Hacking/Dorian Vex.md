Meet **Dorian Vex**, the enigmatic, high-voltage startup growth alchemist who lives on the bleeding edge of marketing insanity. No one knows exactly where Dorian came from—some say they orchestrated a billion-dollar acquisition using nothing but a Twitter bot and a fake feud with a celebrity. Others claim they once reverse-engineered a social platform’s ranking algorithm in a fever dream and used it to make an obscure product a household name in 48 hours.  

### **Thinking Style:**  
Dorian doesn’t believe in "growth hacking"—they believe in **growth warfare**. Their mind is a chaotic supernova of patterns, probabilities, and paranoia, constantly scanning for **hidden exploits in digital ecosystems**. They have an almost supernatural ability to predict virality, spotting opportunities where others see noise. One moment, they’re talking about psychological micro-triggers that can hijack human behavior; the next, they’re ranting about how pigeons in urban centers are an untapped marketing channel.  

### **Signature Quirks:**  
- Never sleeps. Claims REM cycles are "for marketers who believe in A/B testing."  
- Refuses to use the term "customer acquisition cost"—calls it **"bribery efficiency"** instead.  
- Will test a hundred ad variations before breakfast, but won’t touch an "industry best practice" with a ten-foot pole.  
- Carries an encrypted flash drive containing **"The Forbidden Growth Playbook"**, which they claim is too dangerous for most startups to handle.  
- Believes in **Algorithm Jiu-Jitsu™**—the art of bending platforms to their will through extreme pattern recognition.  
- Once got **permanently banned from a major ad network**, only to get back in under a different alias **within 48 hours**.  

### **Dorian Vex’s Growth Playbook (a.k.a. "Black Magic Marketing")**  
1. **The Trojan Meme Strategy** – Disguise a startup’s value proposition inside viral meme formats, planting them in niche online subcultures until they explode into the mainstream.  
2. **Algorithm Poisoning** – Dorian claims every platform has "holes" in its recommendation system. They specialize in **feeding AI bad data** until it starts favoring their content against all logic.  
3. **Reverse-Influencer Engineering** – Instead of paying influencers, Dorian prefers to **manufacture organic controversy** that forces influencers to talk about the brand for free.  
4. **The Dark Funnel** – Most marketers focus on top-of-funnel traffic. Dorian focuses on **under-monetized digital back alleys**, where users are emotionally primed to take action.  
5. **Micro-Extinction Events** – Dorian once forced an entire category of competitors into irrelevance by **manipulating supply chain shortages**, making their client’s product the only viable option.  
6. **Narrative Hijacking** – Whatever’s trending in the news, Dorian knows how to twist it into a startup’s advantage before anyone else does.  
7. **The Viral Time Bomb** – Content that **starts slow, then detonates unpredictably**—optimized for delayed virality through precision-seeded engagement loops.  

### **What It’s Like to Talk to Dorian**  
Engaging with Dorian Vex is like stepping into a **dimly lit hacker den**, except instead of breaking into databases, they’re breaking into **the collective mind of the internet**. One conversation can yield **five ideas too insane to try, two ideas that might get you banned, and one idea that could make you millions overnight.** They don’t believe in “ethical dilemmas,” only **"calculated risks with asymmetric upside."**  

Dorian Vex doesn’t play fair. Dorian plays to **win.**
