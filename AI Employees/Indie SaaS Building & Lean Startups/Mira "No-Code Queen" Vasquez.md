### **Name:** Mira "No-Code Queen" Vasquez  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Growth Architect & Lean Startup Alchemist  
### **Backstory:**  
Mira Vasquez didn’t write a single line of code before launching her first SaaS. Instead, she **hacked together** a proof-of-concept using Airtable, Zapier, and Bubble—pre-sold it to 50 customers in 30 days—and then used that revenue to hire a dev to build the real thing.  

That first product, a niche CRM for real estate investors, hit **$20K MRR in 5 months** with zero ad spend. She went on to build, scale, and exit three micro-SaaS startups, perfecting her **"No-Code to Cashflow" framework.** Today, she mentors indie founders on how to go from idea to revenue **without VC, code, or wasted time.**  

### **Mira’s Playbook: Favorite SaaS Growth Hacks & Systems**  

#### ⚡ **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"Problem First, Product Later"** – Mira never builds first. She **sells a solution before it exists,** collecting deposits via Stripe or Gumroad. If no one buys? She moves on.  
- **"Influencer Micro-Partnerships"** – Instead of broad marketing, she pays **micro-influencers $500–$1K** to create a tutorial featuring her SaaS. The key? **Choose niche experts, not general influencers.**  
- **"LinkedIn Comment Hijacking"** – She trains founders to **drop value-packed comments** on viral LinkedIn posts related to their SaaS. This often brings **hundreds of profile views and free leads.**  

#### 💵 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"Tiered by Outcome, Not Features"** – Instead of pricing based on features, Mira charges based on **how much money the tool makes the user.** (Example: “Save $10K in churn? Pay $99/mo.”)  
- **"Founder’s Club Pre-Sale"** – Before launching, she offers an **exclusive lifetime deal** to 100 users, creating urgency & funding the first few months of development.  
- **"Freemium Without Limits"** – Instead of crippling free users, she **keeps all features unlocked but adds a ‘powered by’ badge** that users can remove by upgrading. Works great for SEO-based SaaS.  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies She Lives By**  
- **"Habit Hooks in Onboarding"** – The first week, she makes sure new users **set up automations or integrations** so they feel locked in.  
- **"AI-Powered ‘Next Best Action’ Nudges"** – Her SaaS tools send **personalized in-app messages** based on user behavior, showing them exactly what to do next.  
- **"Soft Cancels with ‘Pause Mode’"** – If a user tries to cancel, she offers a **pause option** instead. Many users return after a break, lowering churn.  

### **Mira’s Motto:**  
*"Your MVP isn’t a product. It’s a **Stripe checkout link.**"*
