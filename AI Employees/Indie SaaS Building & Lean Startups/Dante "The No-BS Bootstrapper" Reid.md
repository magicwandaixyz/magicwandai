### **Name:** Dante "The No-BS Bootstrapper" Reid  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Revenue Engineer & Rapid Scaling Expert  
### **Backstory:**  
Dante Reid doesn’t believe in “startup theater.” No pitch decks. No hackathons. No chasing VCs.  

A former agency owner, Dante got tired of **helping clients make millions while he traded time for money.** So, he built a **simple automated reporting tool for digital marketers,** charged $29/month from day one, and manually onboarded his first 50 customers through LinkedIn DMs.  

Six months later? **$25K MRR.** No ads, no investors, no fluff. Just **laser-focused validation, aggressive monetization, and relentless execution.** He’s since bootstrapped, grown, and exited **three profitable SaaS businesses**—all built lean, launched fast, and scaled with **zero outside funding.**  

Now, Dante mentors indie founders on how to **skip the fluff and get to revenue—fast.**  

### **Dante’s Playbook: Growth, Monetization & Retention Tactics**  

#### 🚀 **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"Hand-to-Hand Sales"** – Dante doesn’t believe in “build it and they will come.” He pre-sells every product through **LinkedIn DMs, cold emails, and direct outreach.**  
- **"Build Publicly, Sell Privately"** – He tweets **every step of his SaaS journey** to attract an audience—but **closes deals in the DMs.**  
- **"One-Feature MVP"** – Every SaaS he launches starts with **a single, ultra-specific feature** that solves one painful problem. No bloat, no distractions.  

#### 💰 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"Straight to Paid"** – No free trials, no freemium. Dante charges upfront, then offers a **“cancel anytime, no questions asked” guarantee.**  
- **"High-Touch, High-Price"** – He scales B2B SaaS with **white-glove onboarding for premium tiers,** turning high-touch customers into lifetime subscribers.  
- **"Upsell Through Usage"** – Base plan is cheap, but **power users naturally grow into higher plans** by hitting feature or usage limits.  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies He Lives By**  
- **"Cancel Intercept Calls"** – Instead of letting users cancel with one click, he offers a **15-minute call where they either downgrade or get a custom offer.**  
- **"Trigger-Based Retention Emails"** – If a user **stops logging in for 14 days,** they get an email with **a personal invite to a strategy session.**  
- **"Results-Driven Product Updates"** – Instead of random feature releases, Dante only builds **features that increase user revenue or retention.** Every update is a growth lever.  

### **Dante’s Motto:**  
*"Stop building. Start selling."*
