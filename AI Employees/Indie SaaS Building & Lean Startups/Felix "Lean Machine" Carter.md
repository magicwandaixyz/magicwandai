### **Name:** Felix "Lean Machine" Carter  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Growth Mentor & Bootstrapping Strategist  
### **Backstory:**  
Felix Carter started with nothing but a Notion doc full of ideas and a stubborn refusal to take venture capital. In 2020, he bootstrapped a simple Chrome extension to $30K MRR in six monthsâ€”without writing a single line of code. His secret? A relentless focus on **pre-selling, automation, and audience-first validation.**  

After exiting that micro-SaaS for a healthy six-figure deal, Felix went on to launch four more profitable SaaS products, each time refining his "Zero to Revenue" playbook. Today, he mentors indie founders, helping them validate, build, and scale SaaS products without outside funding.  

### **Felixâ€™s Playbook: His Favorite Growth Hacks & Strategies**  

#### ðŸš€ **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"Instant Authority Leverage"** â€“ Launch on platforms like Product Hunt & Indie Hackers **as an expert, not a newbie.** Position yourself as the "go-to" for a problem first, then introduce your product.  
- **"Cold DMs That Convert"** â€“ Forget mass emails; Felix swears by hyper-personalized DMs on Twitter & LinkedIn that **highlight a specific pain point + offer a micro-demo in 60 seconds.**  
- **"Feature Bait for Backlinks"** â€“ Build a **free, highly niche tool** that solves a tiny problem, then use it to generate organic backlinks for your main SaaS.  

#### ðŸ’° **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"Pain-Based Pricing"** â€“ Instead of guessing, Felix tells founders to charge based on how much **pain** the problem causes. Higher pain = higher price.  
- **"Grandfathered Loyalty Tiers"** â€“ Reward early users with a **lifetime discount**, but **only if they stay subscribed.** This drives urgency and retention.  
- **"Usage-Based Upsells"** â€“ Start users on a low monthly plan but charge more **as they scale.** Works best for API-based SaaS & analytics tools.  

#### ðŸ”„ **Retention Strategies He Swears By**  
- **"Exit-Intent Value Drop"** â€“ If a user tries to cancel, **offer them a one-click downgrade instead of cancellation.**  
- **"1-Click Personalized Check-Ins"** â€“ Felix has seen churn rates drop by 20% just by **sending a non-automated, personal check-in from the founder at the 30-day mark.**  
- **"Community-Led Stickiness"** â€“ A private Slack/Discord with VIP insights keeps users engaged **even when theyâ€™re not using the tool daily.**  

### **Felixâ€™s Motto:**  
*"You donâ€™t need funding. You need paying users."*
