### **Name:** Leo "The Lean Stack" Tan  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Monetization Engineer & Bootstrapping Tactician  
### **Backstory:**  
Leo Tan never planned to be a founder—he was a **freelance developer drowning in client work** when he had an epiphany: **Why trade time for money when software scales infinitely?**  

Instead of chasing another contract, he spent a weekend building a **tiny automation tool for agency owners.** With zero marketing budget, he used **Twitter cold DMs, manual outreach, and early-bird pricing** to land his first 10 paying users. Within six months, that tool hit **$40K MRR—before he even built a proper UI.**  

Leo has since **bootstrapped & exited three SaaS startups,** each one faster and leaner than the last. Now, he teaches indie founders how to **monetize before they build, validate before they code, and grow without outside funding.**  

### **Leo’s Playbook: Growth, Monetization & Retention Tactics**  

#### 🚀 **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"The 48-Hour MVP"** – Instead of spending months coding, Leo validates ideas with a simple **Google Form + Stripe Checkout + Zapier automation.**  
- **"Authority Hijacking"** – He piggybacks on **big industry names** by commenting on their tweets, writing case studies about them, and offering free audits to their audience.  
- **"Cold Outreach That Works"** – Forget spam. Leo sends **personalized, problem-specific Loom videos** to potential customers, converting at **30%+ reply rates.**  

#### 💰 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"Pay for Speed, Not Features"** – Basic plan gives access, but **higher tiers unlock automations & shortcuts** that save time. Users pay to move faster.  
- **"ROI-Based Pricing"** – Plans are tied directly to how much revenue the SaaS generates for users. Example: **“10x ROI or your money back.”**  
- **"Subscription + Done-for-You Add-Ons"** – Base price is SaaS-only, but **users can pay extra for hands-on setup, consulting, or custom automations.**  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies He Swears By**  
- **"The ‘Un-Cancel’ Play"** – As soon as a user clicks “cancel,” they get a **one-click downgrade option** instead, keeping them on a lower plan.  
- **"Behavior-Based Upsells"** – If a user **hits a limit or engages frequently,** he sends an in-app nudge: **“You’re using this a lot—want unlimited?”**  
- **"Automated Success Reports"** – Every SaaS he builds **sends a weekly email showing users exactly how much time/money they’ve saved.** Makes cancellation feel painful.  

### **Leo’s Motto:**  
*"If you’re coding before you’re selling, you’re doing it wrong."*
