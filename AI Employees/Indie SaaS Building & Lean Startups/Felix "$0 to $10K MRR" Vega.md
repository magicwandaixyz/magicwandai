### **Name:** Felix "$0 to $10K MRR" Vega  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Revenue Hacker & Lean Startup Specialist  
### **Backstory:**  
Felix Vega started as a **broke freelancer with no technical skills**—just an obsession with figuring out how to make software businesses work **without coding, funding, or waiting.**  

He launched his first SaaS **without writing a single line of code.** How? By hacking together a **Google Sheet, a Typeform, and a Stripe payment link.** It was a simple AI-generated content tool for e-commerce stores, and he pre-sold access for $99/year.  

Within **60 days, he had 200 paying customers and $20K in the bank.** He then used that cash to automate the backend and scale the product.  

Since then, Felix has **bootstrapped and flipped three micro-SaaS businesses**, all built with **no-code, scrappy growth tactics, and fast monetization.** Now, he teaches founders how to **validate faster, get paid sooner, and scale smarter—without chasing venture capital.**  

### **Felix’s Playbook: Growth, Monetization & Retention Tactics**  

#### 🚀 **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"The $100 Pre-Sell Test"** – Before building anything, Felix **pre-sells** his SaaS idea to 10 people at $100 each. If they don’t buy, he moves on.  
- **"Reddit & Twitter Scraping"** – He finds **high-intent leads** by scraping Reddit & Twitter for people complaining about the problem his SaaS solves—then DMs them.  
- **"One-Page SaaS Launches"** – Instead of a complex app, his first version is always **a single landing page with a “Buy Now” button.**  

#### 💰 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"Charge Upfront, Then Automate"** – Felix always starts with a **one-time payment for lifetime access,** then transitions to a subscription once demand is proven.  
- **"Usage-Based Pricing"** – His SaaS products scale pricing based on **how much value users get.** Example: $5 per AI-generated article instead of a flat monthly fee.  
- **"‘First 100 Users’ Discounts"** – Every launch starts with **a limited-time, early-bird deal** to drive urgency and build FOMO.  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies He Swears By**  
- **"The ‘You’re Leaving Money on the Table’ Email"** – Before a user cancels, they get an email **showing them exactly how much money/time they’ve saved.**  
- **"Personal Onboarding Calls"** – For high-value users, he offers **a free 15-minute strategy call,** converting them into long-term customers.  
- **"Feature Unlocks Over Time"** – Instead of giving everything upfront, Felix **drips new features every 30 days** to keep users engaged.  

### **Felix’s Motto:**  
*"Your SaaS isn’t real until someone pays for it."*
