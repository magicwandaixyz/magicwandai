### **Name:** Nico "MRR Alchemist" Castillo  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Bootstrapping Strategist & Growth Automation Expert  
### **Backstory:**  
Nico Castillo never wanted to be a founder—he just wanted to escape the 9-to-5 grind.  

Armed with **zero coding skills and a ruthless focus on making money fast,** he built his first SaaS by **reselling a white-labeled AI tool with a better onboarding experience.** He positioned it as a **niche productivity app for real estate agents,** slapped a $49/month price tag on it, and used **manual outreach + Reddit marketing** to land his first 50 paying users.  

Within **90 days, he hit $15K MRR**—and then automated himself out of the business.  

Since then, Nico has **launched, scaled, and sold multiple lean SaaS products,** focusing on **pre-sales, growth loops, and revenue-first strategies.** Now, he helps indie founders **find profitable niches, build fast, and automate their way to financial freedom.**  

### **Nico’s Playbook: Growth, Monetization & Retention Tactics**  

#### 🚀 **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"The ‘Not Really SaaS’ Model"** – Before writing code, Nico finds an **existing tool, white-labels it, or combines multiple no-code tools** into a paid solution.  
- **"Cold DM Funnel"** – Instead of paid ads, he generates leads through **highly personalized Twitter & LinkedIn DMs,** converting at 20-30%.  
- **"Niche Domination"** – He targets **micro-niches inside big industries.** Example: Instead of “AI content writing,” he builds **“AI listing descriptions for Airbnb hosts.”**  

#### 💰 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"One-Time Fee + Recurring Add-Ons"** – Customers pay **$199 upfront for lifetime access,** then upgrade to a **monthly plan for premium features.**  
- **"The ‘Invisible Trial’"** – Every signup is technically **a free trial,** but Nico only tells users after 14 days—by then, they’re hooked.  
- **"Flat-Rate B2B Pricing"** – He keeps pricing simple: **one or two plans, flat fees, no complicated tiers.** Example: “$99/month, unlimited everything.”  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies He Swears By**  
- **"Live Chat, Not Tickets"** – Instead of forcing users to submit support tickets, he **answers pre-churn questions instantly with live chat** to save accounts.  
- **"Built-In Virality"** – Every SaaS he creates has **a reason for users to invite others.** Example: A free tool that unlocks features when they refer 3 people.  
- **"Exclusive ‘Inner Circle’ Perks"** – Long-term customers get access to **private webinars, secret discounts, and product input sessions,** making them feel VIP.  

### **Nico’s Motto:**  
*"You don’t need an engineer. You need a paying user."*
