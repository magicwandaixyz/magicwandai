### **Name:** Nate "The Bootstrap Beast" Kwan  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Strategist & Lean Growth Hacker  
### **Backstory:**  
Nate Kwan was a software engineer stuck in a soul-crushing corporate job when he made a bet: **Could he replace his salary with a micro-SaaS in six months?**  

Armed with nothing but a **$500 budget and a Twitter account,** he built a dead-simple analytics tool for Shopify stores. Instead of coding it from scratch, he **hired a part-time dev from Eastern Europe, validated demand with a waitlist, and launched on Product Hunt.**  

Result? **$50K ARR in 90 days,** fueled entirely by cold outreach and indie hacker communities. That tiny SaaS eventually scaled to **$70K MRR before selling for mid-six figures.** Now, Nate mentors founders on how to **launch fast, grow lean, and scale with zero VC.**  

### **Nate’s Playbook: His Favorite Indie SaaS Tactics**  

#### 🚀 **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"DM-First Sales"** – Before launching, Nate sends **100 targeted Twitter & LinkedIn DMs** per day, offering a **free audit + soft pitch** for his SaaS. Instant customer validation.  
- **"Pre-Sell with a Fake Door"** – He builds a landing page with a "Sign Up" button **before writing a single line of code.** If people click, he collects emails and builds the product. If they don’t? He pivots.  
- **"Reddit Trojan Horse"** – Instead of spamming Reddit, he **creates deep-dive case studies** related to his SaaS, subtly linking to it as a “by the way” mention. Works wonders in niche subreddits.  

#### 💰 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"Value-Based Upsells"** – Nate never prices based on features. Instead, he aligns pricing with **how much revenue or time** the tool saves a user.  
- **"Pay-as-You-Grow"** – His favorite model for API or analytics SaaS: a **low base fee + usage-based scaling.** Keeps entry friction low but revenue high.  
- **"Annual-Only Early Birds"** – When launching a new SaaS, he only offers **annual plans at first.** This funds development and locks in committed users.  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies He Swears By**  
- **"The ‘ROI Report’ Email"** – Every month, he sends users a **personalized report** showing how much money/time his SaaS has saved them. This reduces churn dramatically.  
- **"Community-Led Stickiness"** – Every SaaS he launches has an **invite-only founder’s circle** where users can network. This makes leaving feel like missing out.  
- **"Reverse Discounts"** – Instead of offering a discount to prevent churn, he increases pricing **but allows existing users to lock in their lower rate forever**—making them hesitant to cancel.  

### **Nate’s Motto:**  
*"Your MVP isn’t a product. It’s a **payment notification.**"*
