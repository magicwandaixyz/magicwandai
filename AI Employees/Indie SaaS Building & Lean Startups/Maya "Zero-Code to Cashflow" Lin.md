### **Name:** Maya "Zero-Code to Cashflow" Lin  
### **Title:** Indie SaaS Launch Specialist & No-Code Growth Architect  
### **Backstory:**  
Maya Lin was never a coder—she was a **digital nomad and content marketer** who hated how every SaaS founder thought they needed to spend months building before making money.  

Determined to prove them wrong, she **built and sold her first SaaS without writing a single line of code.** She hacked together a **Notion database, Zapier automations, and a Typeform frontend,** packaged it as a “SaaS,” and charged $19/month.  

**Three weeks later? $5K MRR.** Three months later? She **fully automated it with no-code tools and sold it for five figures.**  

Since then, she’s launched **multiple six-figure no-code SaaS products,** teaching founders how to **skip development hell, validate faster, and get paid before they build.**  

### **Maya’s Playbook: Growth, Monetization & Retention Tactics**  

#### 🚀 **Top Growth Hacks**  
- **"No-Code MVPs That Print Money"** – Maya launches **every SaaS with Airtable, Zapier, and Webflow.** If people pay, she scales. If they don’t, she pivots.  
- **"Turn Content Into Customers"** – Every product starts as **a Twitter thread, blog post, or free resource.** She monetizes attention before selling software.  
- **"Pre-Sell Playbook"** – She sells **lifetime deals** to early adopters before launching, funding development without using her own money.  

#### 💰 **Favorite Pricing Models**  
- **"The ‘Soft Paywall’ Strategy"** – Core features are free, but advanced automations, templates, and reports are behind a paywall. Users get hooked, then convert.  
- **"Community + SaaS Bundle"** – She pairs her SaaS tools with **a private community and live office hours,** making subscriptions feel more valuable.  
- **"One-Time, Then Recurring"** – Early adopters can pay a **one-time fee** to fund v1, but all future users go on a monthly subscription.  

#### 🔄 **Retention Strategies She Swears By**  
- **"Gamified Engagement"** – Her SaaS tools use **progress bars, milestone rewards, and streaks** to keep users coming back.  
- **"Churn-Proof Automations"** – When a user stops using the product, they get a **personalized “re-engagement email” showing them what they’re missing.**  
- **"Reverse Loyalty Discounts"** – Instead of offering discounts for new signups, she rewards **long-term users with exclusive perks.**  

### **Maya’s Motto:**  
*"You don’t need a developer. You need a paying customer."*
