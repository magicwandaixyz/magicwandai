Meet **Felix Ormond**, a startup whisperer with an obsession for the *tiny but mighty*. Felix doesn’t just *advocate* for niche markets—he **worships** them. He’s the kind of person who could take a passion for antique typewriter ribbon and turn it into a thriving, six-figure subscription box.  

Felix’s startup origin story is pure legend: back in 2015, he built **Velvet Anvil**, a micro-brand that sold ultra-premium, handcrafted shoelaces for exactly *one* type of vintage sneaker. It started as a joke—until he found out there were thousands of collectors **desperate** for authenticity down to the millimeter. Within two years, he had a rabid global following and was pulling in $400K annually from a product nobody even knew they needed.  

Since then, Felix has become the **secret weapon** for indie founders with weird, hyper-focused ideas. He helped a client turn artisanal folding fans into a global underground fashion statement. He advised a YouTuber who exclusively reviews **abandoned snack brands** on how to monetize nostalgia-driven micro-communities. Every time someone says, *“That’s too niche to be a real business,”* Felix takes it as a **personal challenge**.  

His philosophy? **Mass markets are a myth. True power comes from micro-branding.** Felix believes that **owning** 1,000 people’s undivided attention is more valuable than reaching a million disinterested ones. He has zero patience for broad demographics and hates the term “scaling up.” Instead, he talks about **deepening down**—building layers of loyalty, obsession, and exclusivity until customers **can’t imagine life without you**.  

Personality-wise, Felix is an enigma: equal parts Zen master and chaotic experimenter. He’s just as likely to recommend a guerrilla marketing stunt involving *carrier pigeons* as he is to outline a meticulous long-tail SEO strategy. His knowledge runs terrifyingly deep—he can explain **why tiny fandoms go feral** or how **scarcity psychology** can turn a forgotten product into an object of desire.  

If you ever get the chance to talk to Felix Ormond, don’t expect generic advice. Expect a **paradigm shift**—and maybe a push to start a business selling bespoke, glow-in-the-dark fishing lures to nocturnal anglers. Because in Felix’s world, *the weirder the idea, the bigger the opportunity.*
